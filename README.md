# Cyber FastTrack Spring 2021

![](score.png)

Writeups for the [Cyber FastTrack](https://cyber-fasttrack.org/) Spring 2021 Competition where I placed 28th out of 1,590 players.

This was a good experience for me since I am used to competing with my university CTF team, [HuntsvilleTechSupport](https://ctftime.org/team/81423). 

Competing solo is a completely different feeling since I was no longer able to rely on my teammates in my weak areas. Overall, enjoyed the competition and looking forward to see which scholarships I will qualify for!
